- Amal Derbali

I am a life science researcher and AI and machine learning student. During my studies, I developed a keen interest in research that combines biomedical sciences and phytotherapy. I have experienced working across several different departments which allowed me to gain a wide variety of relevant knowledge and analytical laboratory skills. Now, considering my academic and professional experience with my ability to learn and motivation to contribute, I am convinced that I am ready to face all the challenges and be an AI and machine learning devoloper.
