# Amal Derbali

## Doctor in Biology and AI and machine learning student. 

- During my previous research studies in Biological Sciences, I had experienced working across several different departments which allowed me to gain a wide variety of relevant knowledge and analytical skills. 
- Now and after I decided to change my track, I am a studying to become a devoloper in artificial intelligence and machine learning in IT-HÃ¶gskolan.
- Considering my academic experience and my motivation to learn and to contribute, I am ready to face all the challenges and achieve my goals. 

- This is a selection of Labs that I have worked on during my study:
