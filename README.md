# Amal Derbali



- I am a doctor in biology and AI and machine learning student. During my studies, I developed a keen interest in research that combines biomedical sciences and phytotherapy. I have experienced working across several different departments which allowed me to gain a wide variety of relevant knowledge and analytical skills. 
- Now and after I decided to change my track I am a studying to be a devoloper in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in IT-HÃ¶gskolan.
- Considering my academic experience and my motivation to learn and to contribute, I am ready to face all the challenges and achieve my goals.
